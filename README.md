# First-Rep

New with programming, new with github.
Studied a little HTML, CSS, and python.  
Decided to focus on python first.
Working on some small insignificant projects as practice.
The mm pb picker I made to choose lottery numbers for me.

Then I wanted to build on that and have a program to simulate thousands of lottery drawings
and cross-ref each pick with my listed picks that would tell me how many times I matched:
1 ball
2 ball
3 ball etc.

Also the whether or not the powerball/megaball was a match as well.

If you happen to see this let me know if I could have done something better or any improvements.
This is the first project I have created on my own.  In my first repository ever on github.  And the first code I have shared anywhere.
Any tips or resources anyone may offer is appreciated.
